 Team name & project title - Ai Buggers & SwasthyaSetu stress free
Problem statement addressed - In todayâ€™s fast-paced and demanding world, individuals increasingly suffer from stress, anxiety, and emotional exhaustion. While traditional therapeutic services such as counseling and therapy are available, they are often expensive, time-consuming, or geographically inaccessible to many. Additionally, the effectiveness of stress-relief methods varies widely depending on individual preferences and needs. There is a lack of a centralized, accessible, and user-friendly platform that provides personalized, diverse, and effective stress-management solutions. This gap highlights the urgent need for a holistic digital solution that empowers users to manage their mental well-being conveniently and affordably.
